* Designed and built an information visualization system based on U.S. News and Q.S. datasets, exploring university rankings in institution level, chronological level, and country level.  

* Created three visualizations (dual axes bar chart, parallel coordinates, scatterplot) using AJAX technology(html, css, javascript), visualization library d3.js, and ui library jQuery/Bootstrap.  

* Compared differences of two rankings; observed patterns and fluctuation of QS ranking within 5 years; seek relationships between national education levels, GDP per capita and world population by countries.
